# Sprint 3 Reflection
"Near the end of the sprint, write up a brief report on how your team performed this sprint, using the burndown chart from the board as the basis for discussion. Feel free to also discuss your processes as a whole. Were any changes your made this sprint constructive or detrimental? Do you have any plans for doing things differently next sprint?"

This sprint was harder for the team to organize around due to the introduction of very one-sided tasks, like collision. Desigining the collision system for the future when we don't have plans for content was difficult, but we got a rudimentary but powerful system up that should handle theoretical infinite entity speeds so clipping out of bounds should be impossible (unless spawned in invalid positions). Loading from files also proved annoying as XML does not cooperate intuitively. Deserializing requires setting access modifiers to a visible enough level so the deserializer can access it, something that the GSON library in Java, for instance, doesn't make you worry about (probably thanks to Java's built-in support from the start for serialization code [like the transient keyword]). Some quirks of the room loading includes having to list every entity out as a subclass in the LivingEntity class so it can be recognized properly and deserialized into the game. Maybe we can write a custom serializer factory that handles this later but you guys aren't us to take this class so...

Next sprint I hope team members can fully commit to one idea and not corrupt other people's work on the main branch and push unbroken or incomplete code. We might need to switch to a branch model and worry more about merging than trying to keep everything synced.
