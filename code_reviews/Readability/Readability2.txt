Comments:
Combining the X and Y axis movement into one method would've required duplication of very similar looking code but I wonder if there's a better way to handle it to avoid having to call it twice with a boolean passed in for each axis.
Iterations over the entities and tiles seem clean to me. Perhaps we can do the same with the doors and avoid hard coding the door values, even if they always are the same across every room.
The constructor should be reduced down by avoiding the if else statement garbage in the beginning. I'll be handling this before the submission deadline.
