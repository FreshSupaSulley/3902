Room.cs Code Review

Sprint 3
30minutes

We used the number line 14, 9 for size of the room and 6,7,	56,69,118,119 for door indices. 
This numbers might not be clear. we could use define these number for better readability like
int room_width = 14 and int room_height = 9. This will make easier to understand the code when we use these 
number later again in the code.

isBorderTile method is just one line and using magic number. this could make easier to read with assign variable with
index % 14 and another variable with index / 14 to not repeat multiple time and easier to read.

The constructor of the room could be more simplified. if we make all the if statements separate method and 
call that method in the constructor.

HandleAxisCollision is hard to read especiallly one long line in the middle of the method. we could pull out some 
codes and make smaller methods and call in HandleAxisCollision.
