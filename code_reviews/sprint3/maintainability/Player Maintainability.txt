Comments:
Player was compressed recently to keep movement controls inside of itself and rely less on public static bullshit shenanigans (why is ICommand and dictionaries a recommended practice??). As the person who rewrote that class,
I humbly declare it to be fairly maintainable and if anything it would be harder to read now but only because it has more code. However, that code is organized. I think it's good to go for the future as collision and shit
is also handled in parent classes or in Room.
