Sprint 5
Game/Items/Banana.cs
Erich Sullivan Boschert and Ty Fredrick
10 minutes + time developing with it
I think the code surrounding the use of the Banana item is incredibly readable, with most of it simply coming down to activating the use function based on the previously defined player, which is neatly defined for the KeyResponse object. I think the switch case statement for detemining the initial velocity was very nice and readable. I needed to debug something earlier today with regards to the handling of the direction and it was immediately apparent to me how the code functioned and how it may be changed to fix the issue I was encountering. I found the math that was used, though relatively complex compared to the math that was used by the rest of the program, to be very readable and understandable as making a path from the user and back to it like a boomerang.
