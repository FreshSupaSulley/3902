lots of magic number. if we assign variables to these it will make easier read and maintain
for the later uses.

load method for texture

all of the room transition stuff are inside the draw methods. it could be its own methods so we can modifty 
room transition without messing with other stuff in the draw.

we are going to have more rooms and we can make method just for loading rooms and put them into dictionary so it 
called the same room later instead of loading individual room separately inside the load content. and if we need to 
add more rooms we can modify load room method.
