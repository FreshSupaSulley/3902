Comments:
livingentity class well writen codes maintaining entity's animation, collision, health management, and drawing, making it easy to understand and extend.
livingentity makes easier to check collision between entities which will cause damage. health and damage is also tracked in here. it's easy to maintain
with separate methods and easy to change fix in case we need to test or change.
