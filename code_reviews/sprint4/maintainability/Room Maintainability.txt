Comments:
Room is now effectively the heart of the State.Game class. It handles ticking of entities, linking hitboxes together, etc. In a perfect world, this should probably be combined in the State.Game class but since each room
is effectively their own little world, this could suffice for now. One thing I'd like to address one day is the hitbox system, as its a bit crude and only differentiates between the player's hitboxes and the entity's
hitboxes. Right now there's a lot of type checking to see if the hitboxes should connect but this is a minor issue that could be addressed at a different time. Other than that, I think room does the job fairly well
and could see little changes for the rest of the project.
