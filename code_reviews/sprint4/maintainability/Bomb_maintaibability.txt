-m "The bomb class displays the traits of a highly maintainable class as it declares many of the variables it uses locally, several of which are primatives,
and only has void methods that never access global variables, so an alteration to the code could neither break other code by returning an invalid value or modifying
the value of any other object used by another class or instance."
