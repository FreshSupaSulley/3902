# Sprint 2
## Purpose of this file
"Write up a document with useful information on your project. This might include: program controls, descriptions of known bugs that program has, and details of any tools or processes your team used that aren't explicitly required (for example, calculating and using Code Metrics as part of your design process)"

## Controls
As described in Key Mappings for this sprint. WASD and arrow keys move Monoko (name of our player character). Z and N cause an attack animation. 1, 2, and 3 switch between different items the player is holding. The player will always do the  "POW!" animation for now, but only if you're holding an item, that item will be used. E switches the player to a damaged sprite. U and I switch between the lone item on the map (not the one being held by the player). O and P cycle between enemies.

## Known bugs
