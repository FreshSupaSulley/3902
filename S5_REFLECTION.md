# Sprint 5 Reflection

"Near the end of the sprint, write up a brief report on how your team performed this sprint, using the burndown chart from the board as the basis for discussion. Feel free to also discuss your processes as a whole. Were any changes your made this sprint constructive or detrimental? Do you have any plans for doing things differently next sprint?"

In this sprint, it seemed that every team member knew what they needed to do, with everyone going their separate ways to work on tasks and communicating when they needed help or when a bug was found. However, throughout this sprint we have had many issues with people pushing code that breaks existing systems, very often having to do with the functionality of the doors. During this sprint we moved away from some of the documentation steps that we previously did in favor of just being more communicative and writing more readable code, that way we could save time and instead just focus on the functionality rather than cohesion. Most of the work for this sprint has stemmed from the addition of two playes, which has neecessitated significant shifts in many systems and has resulted in many bugs, especially with the doors. We used a Google Doc to be able to better keep track of bugs, features, and tasks that still needed to be dealt with, which worked better with the varying hours that we all work at. I think the lack of adoption of documentation markdown files was ultimately a detriment to the team.
